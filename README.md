# paste.bork.pw
Full source for my pasting service, dubbed 'paste.bork.pw'.

### How to get started
Make sure you have Python 3.7.3!
Git clone this project then open it up in VS Code.
Run `python -m venv env` in the terminal then select it as your default interpreter. Then create a new integrated terminal.
Run `pip install requirements.txt`.

### Notes
This isn't fully complete but I will get around to completing this, along with a UI overhaul. The main features (pasting, sharing, deleting, etc) works perfectly though.
